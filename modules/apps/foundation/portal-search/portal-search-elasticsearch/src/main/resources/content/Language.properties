additional-type-mappings=Additional Type Mappings
additional-type-mappings-help=Custom mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). This value should be set with new field mappings only. If you set this value with any overlapping mappings for default fields, index creation fails. To replace default mappings entirely, use overrideTypeMappings.
bootstrap-mlockall=Bootstrap Mlockall
client-transport-ignore-cluster-name=Client Transport Ignore Cluster Name
client-transport-nodes-sampler-interval=Client Transport Nodes Sampler Interval
client-transport-sniff=Client Transport Sniff
cluster-name=Cluster Name

http-cors-enabled=Http CORS Enabled
http-enabled=Http Enabled
index-name-prefix=Index Name Prefix
index-name-prefix-help=The prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also reindex the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.
log-exceptions-only=Log Exceptions Only
log-exceptions-only-help=If this is checked, logs exceptions only from Elasticsearch and does not rethrow them.
network-bind-host=Network Bind Host
network-host=Network Host
network-host-help=The hostname or IP address binded to the node, which is used to publish (advertise) the host to other nodes in the cluster. This is a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time.
network-publish-host=Network Publish Host
operation-mode=Operation Mode
override-type-mappings=Override Type Mappings
override-type-mappings-help=Override mappings for the entire LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). If you set this value, index creation ignores the default mappings definition and any extension points, using this alternative mappings definition instead. Use this if you need LiferayDocumentType to be created with nonstandard mappings for default fields. If you just need to add new custom mappings without overlapping any defaults, use additionalTypeMappings.
retry-on-conflict=Retry on Conflict
sync-search=Synchronized Search
sync-search-help=If this is checked, search runs on invoker thread rather than in Elasticsearch's search thread pool. This only applies to EMBEDDED operation mode.
transport-addresses=Transport Addresses
transport-tcp-port=Transport TCP Port
